1.Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen. (helloworld.py)

2.Write a program that asks the user for his name and greets him with his name. (greetings.py)

3.Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n 

4.Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17 (

5.Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives him the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n. (

6.Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.

7.Write a program that prints all prime numbers. (Note: if your programming language does not support arbitrary size numbers, printing all primes up to the largest number you can represent is fine too.) 

8.Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether his number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. I counts only as one try if the user inputs the same number consecutively. 

9.Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years. 

10. Write a program that computes 4⋅∑k=1106(-1)k+12k-1=4⋅(1-1/3+1/5-1/7+1/9-1/11…).

#TUPLES
# Values in a tuple can't change like lists
# A tuple is a sequence of immutable Python objects. Tuples are sequences, just like lists. The differences between tuples and lists are, the tuples cannot be changed unlike lists and tuples use parentheses, whereas lists use square brackets.
#Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example âˆ’

pi_tuple = (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9)

# Convert tuple into a list
new_tuple = list(pi_tuple)

# Convert a list into a tuple
# new_list = tuple(grocery_list)

# tuples also have len(tuple), min(tuple) and max(tuple)
